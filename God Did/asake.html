 <p> Asake hits another career milestone with over 500 million total career streams on Boomplay.

The multi-faceted artist keeps climbing fast on the Afrobeats ladder, with more claims as an authority in the musical field, Asake joins the Golden club stream on the international music platform Boompay with 500 million total streams.

The music platform took to their social media accounts to announce Asake’s career milestone, Asake joins the few lists of other Nigerian artists to hit this incredible number, names like Kizz Daniel, Burna Boy, Wizkid, and other artists.

Asake keeps the pace going, just like his song “I swear I no go dull”, he’s undoubtedly not dulling his fans, the artist started the year with a ghetto spiritual sound “Yoga” which topped numerous charts in different parts of the world and he recently previewed an unreleased song.

Congrats to Asake on this excellent career landmark.  </p>
